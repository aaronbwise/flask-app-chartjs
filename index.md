## Flask App: Tracking monthly budget data

This is a personal project I used for learning a number of useful technologies, including Postgres, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and ChartJs. It also includes some customization of the Bootstrap starter template.

Currently the data is pulled from a '.csv' file in the static folder. Dummy data can be entered into the backend database. I still have some work to migrate/copy the final database structure and content and connect the visualizations from that source. There is also some work to be done to clean up/minimize the ChartJs code.
